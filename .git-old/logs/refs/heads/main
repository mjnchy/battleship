Ships placed at a cordinate now take into account the length of the ship itself. The selected cordinate is the center of the ship's length now. Additionally, the Ship factory now also reports all unchangable ship properties.

This makes it so that the usage and the function of the method is clearer.

The drawShips function in the interaction module has been renamed to placeShipOnMap and updated to take an array where it will display the ship on each identifier from that array. This makes the placeShipOnMap function more dependent on the placeShips method but allows for a simpler placement of the ships on the UI.

The placeShip method on the Gameboard factory now takes a callback function and executes it on the idArray. The interaction elements object has been moved to the interact function in the interaction module. This ensures that elements created in the dom module are identified in the object.

The changes were basically some quality of life changes where clicking on certain elements would close the list/deselect the selected ship and so on.

It will now only place the ships on the map if the right conditions are met.

As of yet, placing the ships has not been implemented. The goal is to be able to place multiple ships at once and be able to change the location of the ships before the final submission of the command.
